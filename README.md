# Generation-using-RMB
Restricted Boltzmann Machines

Implementation Details
The implemented RBM consist of 2 layers with 784 visible units and 256 hidden units.
Trained using K-Contrastive Divergence with k = 1.
The RBM can be modified as per the use.
It is built solely from scratch using NumPy.
It is trained for MNIST Reconstruction and learning its probability distribution.
Trained on 60000 images.
It is modular in nature so you could change the parameters as per your choice.
